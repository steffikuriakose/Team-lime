08/11/2022 Update: Created programmatic functionality of the chat bot. Can play around with it using the path from the HTML file.
Will update the bot so that the questions and answers are related to finance, add some gamification and experiement with pre set questions.
Working to make the chat bot integratable with the main banking homepage, so that it can pop up at the bottom of the screen.

09/11/2022 Update: Made the chat pop up at the bottom of the screen, instead of taking up a whole webpage, with some "Messenger" style css. Will change the styling in the future.
Next concentrating on the bot questions and answers.

14/11/2022 Update: Changed bot responses to shopping deals. Food, Toys, Car, Energy, Mortgage and Christmas.
To embed chat bot into each page, copy and paste the body html into each webpage (at the bottom is fine). Refer to the css and js script for the chat bot in the head and the end of the body (where it usually goes). Then it should work on every page.
